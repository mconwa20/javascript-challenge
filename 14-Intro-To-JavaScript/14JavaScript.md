# Unit 14-JavaScript Additional Videos and Resources

Hi Everyone! I have put together an additional resource guide to complement the existing unit material and additional guides (VideoGuide.md and StudentGuide.md). I add to this guide whenever I find a new resource, so be sure to check back, or please send me (Madison) over a Slack message if you're looking for a topic in particular that may not be covered with the resources below! 

Not too many additional resources this week, as most JavaScript video guides are super comprehensive and go over everything you need to know to hit the ground running. 

##### Colt Steele JavaScript for Beginners Course (2020):

- [JavaScript for Beginners](https://youtu.be/x2RNw4M6cME)

Reviews everything covered in day 1 and day 2, in addition to more “advanced” variable declarations (“let” and “const”) that we do not use, but are great to know!

Everything covered in this video is referred to as “Vanilla JavaScript,” which is just pure JavaScript without any additional libraries. The kind of JavaScript we review in class (for the most part), and that is also shown in this video, is referred to as ES5, or Ecmascript 5. This is kind of like the “base” version of JavaScript, but JavaScript has evolved over the years and now includes ES6, or Ecmascript 6. You see that version of JavaScript when we review array functions, like .forEach or .map.

Highly recommend if you prefer exercises or coding along! You can do everything for free. Most of the more comprehensive activities require a PRO status, but you can get PRO for free for a week on sign up and you can cancel it before it charges you, and I think a week is sufficient to practice the activities. You can always sign up with a new email if you run out of time!
